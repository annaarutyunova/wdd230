                    A 12-by-5 mile stretch occupying 300,000 acres of Utah’s pristine west desert, the Bonneville Salt Flats is like no other place on earth. A salt crust ranging from a few inches to 5 feet thick forms a perfectly flat, uniform, blindingly white crust as far as the eye can see.

                    Utah’s capital has spent most of two centuries watching the rest of the country’s big cities grow up. It’s been learning, editing, building. Salt Lake City is laid back like Seattle but it’s sunny here five days a week. It’s folksy like Boston without a weird accent.
